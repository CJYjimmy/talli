                    A cookie is a small text file that a website saves on your computer or mobile device when you visit the site. 
                    It enables the website to remember your actions and preferences (such as login, language, font size and other display preferences) 
                    over a period of time, so you don’t have to keep re-entering them whenever you come back to the site or browse from one page to another.

                    On this website, we use cookies to identify unique event attendees. This helps keep voting on our platform accurate and fair 
                    by allowing each visitor only one ballot submission per event. Upon join an event for the first time with our application, 
                    a unique ID is generated for your browser and stored to identify you without needing to collect any additional information 
                    like name or email address. In current and future sessions, we will use that cookie to identify you to allow you to return to an 
                    in-progress ballot and to prevent you from submitting a ballot for an event more than once.
